- **Tkinter**: GUI framework with custom styling
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning for emotion detection
- **SQLite**: Local database for user management and progress tracking

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Required packages:
  - tkinter
  - scikit-learn
  - numpy
  - pandas (optional, for data analysis)

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-emotion-detector.git
cd ai-emotion-detector
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
python EmoBot.py
```

## 📝 Usage Guide

### For Students/Children:

1. **Log in** with your name and grade
2. Complete the **pre-survey** about your AI knowledge
3. Read the **instructions** on how to use the application
4. Use the **main app** to:
   - Test sentences to see what emotions the AI detects
   - Learn about how the AI works through visual explanations
   - Train the AI with your own examples
   - Complete challenges to earn points and badges
5. Complete the **post-survey** to reflect on what you've learned
6. Receive your **certificate of completion**

### For Teachers/Parents:

- Access the **Database Viewer** through the Admin menu to:
  - Monitor student progress

## 🧠 Educational Concepts Covered

- Basic AI concepts and terminology
- Machine learning and pattern recognition
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Training data and model improvement
- AI limitations and mistakes
- Ethical considerations in AI development

## 🔍 How the AI Works

The application uses a simplified Natural Language Processing model:
1. Text is converted to numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
2. A Naive Bayes classifier predicts the emotion based on these features
3. The model displays confidence levels for different emotions
4. Kids can see which words contributed most to the AI's decision
5. The application visualizes the process in a kid-friendly way

## 👩‍🏫 Classroom Integration

This tool is designed for classroom use with features to support educators:
- Track student engagement and understanding
- Export data for assessment
- Monitor learning progress
- Support curriculum on technology, AI, and emotions
